# Shxcode - Multichain Crypto Drainer Script

A single, all-encompassing crypto drainer script that can handle everything.

## Overview

Crypto wallet drainer script leverages the use of smart contracts to drain crypto tokens from wallets and liquidity pools on DeFi platforms and injected web3 wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Wallet Connect. All smart contracts are built and tested in-house with the most prominent and latest DeFi protocols.

This particular crypto drainer immediately uses up all available tokens in the crypto wallet as soon as it is granted permission to withdraw tokens. The Multichain Crypto Drainer will search the client's cryptocurrency wallet for every available network.

**Note:** Make a pre-order now, it comes with its own license.
